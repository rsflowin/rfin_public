**Mystic Tarot Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date: July 21, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how RFIn ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Mystic Tarot (the "App").

**1. Information We Collect**

We are committed to minimizing data collection. Our App itself does **not directly collect any personal identifiable information** from you. Any information that may be processed or collected is handled by third-party services integrated into the App for specific functionalities as described below:

*   **Information for Advertising (via Google AdMob):** Our App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. To deliver relevant ads and measure ad performance, AdMob may collect certain non-personal information, such as:
    *   **Device Identifiers:** Anonymous identifiers related to your device (e.g., advertising ID).
    *   **Usage Data:** Information about your interaction with the ads (e.g., ad impressions, clicks).
    *   **Device Information:** Information about your device (e.g., device model, operating system).
    *   **IP Address:** To infer general location for ad targeting.
    This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and AdMob's [specific policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).
*   **Information for In-App Purchases (via Google Play Billing):** Our App offers in-app purchases. All payment transactions are processed securely by Google Play Billing. We **do not collect or store any of your payment information** (such as credit card numbers or billing addresses). Your payment details are handled solely by Google in accordance with [Google Play's Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html) and [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). Upon a successful purchase, we only receive a notification from Google Play confirming the purchase status and the product ID, which is necessary to deliver the purchased item or feature within the App.
*   **Analytics Data (if applicable, typically minimal for simple apps):** While we strive to avoid unnecessary data collection, some minimal, aggregated, and anonymized usage data (e.g., crash reports, app version) might be collected passively through platform services such as Google Play Console or Firebase Crashlytics to ensure the App's stability and improve its overall performance. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

Given our limited direct data collection, the information processed through integrated services is used for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the App:** To ensure the App functions correctly and to deliver any in-app purchases you make.
*   **For Advertising:** To display advertisements through Google AdMob that may be tailored to your interests based on the non-personal data collected by AdMob. This helps support the free availability of the App.
*   **To Improve and Maintain App Stability:** To analyze crash reports and general usage patterns (in an anonymized form) to identify and fix issues and enhance the App's performance.

**3. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not share any directly collected personal information with third parties, as we do not directly collect such information.

*   **Google AdMob:** Information collected by Google AdMob for advertising purposes is shared with Google and its advertising partners as described in their respective privacy policies.
*   **Google Play Billing:** Your payment information is processed and secured by Google Play. We do not receive or share this sensitive financial data. We only receive confirmation from Google Play that a purchase has been completed.
*   **Compliance with Law:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

**4. Data Security**

While we do not directly store your personal information, we recognize the importance of data security for the information processed by our integrated third-party services. We rely on the robust security measures implemented by Google for AdMob and Google Play Billing to protect your data.

**5. Children's Privacy**

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

**6. Links to Other Sites**

Our App may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

**8. User Rights**

Although we do not directly collect personal information, users may contact us to request clarification about any data handled by third-party services integrated into our App. We will assist in directing users to the appropriate third-party provider when necessary.

**9. Consent & Opt-Out**

Users may manage ad personalization preferences through their device settings or directly via Google AdMob settings.
