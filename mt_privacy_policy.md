### **Mystic Tarot Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date: May 20, 2024**

This Privacy Policy describes how RFIn ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information in connection with your use of our mobile application, Mystic Tarot (the "App").

**1. Introduction and Our Commitment to Privacy**

At Mystic Tarot, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the information collected through our App. We prioritize transparency and aim to keep data collection to an absolute minimum, focusing solely on what is necessary for the App's functionality and to support its free availability.

**2. Information We Collect and Process**

Our App itself does **not directly collect or store any personal identifiable information (PII)** that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, or contact details. Any information that may be processed or collected is handled by reputable third-party services integrated into the App for specific functionalities. We rely on these third parties to comply with applicable data protection laws.

*   **2.1. Information for Advertising (via Google AdMob):**
    Our App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob, which helps us offer the App for free. To deliver relevant ads and measure ad performance, AdMob may collect and process certain data. While we do not directly collect this data, please be aware that Google AdMob may collect:
    *   **Device Identifiers:** Pseudonymous identifiers related to your device (e.g., advertising ID, Android ID, IDFA), which can be reset by users.
    *   **Usage Data:** Information about your interaction with the ads (e.g., ad impressions, clicks).
    *   **Device Information:** Information about your device (e.g., device model, operating system, language settings).
    *   **IP Address:** Used to infer general location for ad targeting and to prevent fraudulent activity. While an IP address can be considered personal data, Google processes this data in an aggregated and anonymized form for most advertising purposes.
    *   **Google's Use of Data:** This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob in accordance with [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and AdMob's [specific policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en). We do not control Google's data practices, but we encourage you to review their policies.

*   **2.2. Information for In-App Purchases (via Google Play Billing):**
    Our App offers in-app purchases to unlock premium features. All payment transactions are processed securely and exclusively by Google Play Billing. We **do not collect, store, or have access to any of your payment information** (such as credit card numbers or billing addresses). Your payment details are handled solely by Google in accordance with [Google Play's Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/index.html) and [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
    Upon a successful purchase, we only receive a non-sensitive notification from Google Play confirming the purchase status and the product ID, which is necessary to deliver the purchased item or feature within the App.

*   **2.3. Analytics Data (for App Performance and Stability):**
    To ensure the App's stability, identify bugs, and improve its overall performance, we may collect minimal, aggregated, and anonymized usage data through platform services such as Google Play Console or Firebase Crashlytics. This data includes:
    *   Crash reports
    *   App version and device type
    *   Basic usage statistics (e.g., number of active users, session duration, in an aggregated form)
    This data is used solely for technical purposes and cannot be used to identify you personally. It is processed in a way that does not allow for individual tracking.

**3. How We Use the Information**

Given our limited direct data collection, the information processed through integrated services is used for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the App:** To ensure the App functions correctly, to deliver any in-app purchases you make, and to provide the core tarot reading functionality.
*   **For Advertising:** To display advertisements through Google AdMob, which may be tailored to your interests based on the non-personal data collected by AdMob. This helps support the free availability of the App.
*   **To Improve and Maintain App Stability:** To analyze crash reports and general usage patterns (in an anonymized form) to identify and fix issues and enhance the App's performance and user experience.

**4. Legal Basis for Processing (Applicable for GDPR Regions)**

For users in regions subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your data on the following legal bases:

*   **Performance of a Contract:** To fulfill our obligations related to providing the App's core functionality and delivering in-app purchases.
*   **Legitimate Interests:** For purposes such as improving app stability, fraud prevention, and providing non-personalized advertising, where our interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
*   **Consent:** For personalized advertising, where required by law (e.g., in the European Economic Area, UK), we will seek your explicit consent before enabling personalized ads. You can manage your consent preferences as described in Section 9.

**5. Data Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not share any directly collected personal information with third parties, as we do not directly collect such information.

*   **Google AdMob:** Information collected by Google AdMob for advertising purposes is shared with Google and its advertising partners as described in their respective privacy policies.
*   **Google Play Billing:** Your payment information is processed and secured by Google Play. We do not receive or share this sensitive financial data. We only receive confirmation from Google Play that a purchase has been completed.
*   **Compliance with Law:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation (e.g., a court order or valid governmental request).

**6. International Data Transfers**

Our third-party service providers (Google AdMob, Google Play Billing, Firebase Crashlytics) may process and store data on servers located outside your country of residence, including in the United States. While data protection laws in these countries may differ from those in your jurisdiction, Google provides appropriate safeguards for international data transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, certifications) as outlined in their respective privacy policies.

**7. Data Security**

While we do not directly store your personal information, we recognize the importance of data security for the information processed by our integrated third-party services. We rely on the robust security measures implemented by Google for AdMob and Google Play Billing, which are designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We strive to use service providers that adhere to high security standards.

**8. Children's Privacy**

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

**9. Your Data Protection Rights**

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data processed by our third-party service providers. While we do not directly control this data, we are committed to helping you exercise these rights. These rights may include:

*   **Right to Access:** To request access to the data Google holds about you.
*   **Right to Rectification:** To request correction of inaccurate data.
*   **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):** To request deletion of your data.
*   **Right to Restriction of Processing:** To request limitations on how your data is processed.
*   **Right to Object:** To object to the processing of your data, particularly for direct marketing.
*   **Right to Data Portability:** To request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

To exercise these rights concerning data processed by Google, please refer to [Google's privacy controls](https://myaccount.google.com/privacy) and follow their instructions. If you require assistance or clarification, please contact us using the details below, and we will guide you to the appropriate Google resource.

**10. Managing Consent and Opt-Out Options**

*   **Advertising Preferences:** You can manage your ad personalization preferences and opt-out of interest-based advertising directly through your device settings:
    *   **Android:** Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization. You can also reset your Advertising ID here.
    *   **iOS:** Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking, and disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track."
*   **GDPR Consent for Personalized Ads:** For users in regions requiring explicit consent (e.g., EEA, UK), the App will present a consent dialogue upon first launch (or at a later point if consent is revoked). You will have the option to consent to personalized ads or opt for non-personalized ads. Your choice will be respected and stored. You can change your consent preferences at any time within the App's settings.

**11. Links to Other Sites**

Our App may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**12. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the terms.
